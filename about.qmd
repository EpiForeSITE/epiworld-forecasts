We're using [epiworldR](https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/epiworldR) (a fast, agent-based modeling tool for epidemiological simulations), GitHub Actions, and Docker to generate disease forecasts for Utah that update automatically.
While we provide an example forecast of COVID-19 case counts, this tool is an open-source, template repository that can easily be adapted to generate forecasts for different diseases.

If you're interested in building an automated forecast using `epiworld-forecasts`, use the [template repo](https://github.com/EpiForeSITE/epiworld-forecasts).
